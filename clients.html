                <p>For several years, we have been fortunate enough to maintain a solid professional relationship with BE&K Building Group. It is because of the effort put into this relationship that our HUB firm was a designated vendor for the 2016 Honda Aircraft Company plant. Although our quality of service is never contingent upon the scale of the project; with something as high profile as this one, particular care was taken to validate BE&K’s selecting of us over our various competitors across the Carolinas.</p>

                <p>In their usual fashion, the Mr Clean Maintenance team were completely invested and dedicated to customer satisfaction from the get go; determined that they would reflect well on the company. The eight employees utilized finished their work far before the projected end date by working 3 fifteen hour days.  This paid off as upon the project’s completion, the consensus was that our employees’ performance was exceptional!</p>
